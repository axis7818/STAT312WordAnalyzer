## Updates
#### 14 October 2015
Hi guys, sorry about any confusion that may have happened with the 5 people, but Professor Smith was pretty awesome and is letting us work in a team of 5. She had also already let us pursue this project despite being an observational 
study. Because of this, I really want to make sure that everyone does their best and we do produce a project that is worthy of the work of 5 people.

Since there is a heavy emphasis on coding for the project, it is great that we have 3 people in a CS discipline. This Github page will be where I am keeping the code for the project. It will allow anyone to view/edit the code as 
they please. I also think that the README file would be a good place to post updates.

Khoa has agreed to reserve a fishbowl in the library from 2-4 every wednesday for us. We can use that as time to work on the project, work on stats homework, or study for midterms. This will start on the 21st.
