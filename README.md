# STAT312WordAnalyzer

## Project Description
We want to analyze the complexity of words based on their source, proportion of vowels, \(etc?\). We will use the length of the word as a basic measure of the word’s complexity and this will be our response variable for all questions. 
* What effect does word source have on Complexity? \(Wikipedia, Scholarly Journal, social media \(twitter\), reddit, etc.\)
* What effect does the proportion of vowels in a word have on Complexity?
* More? Words than end in “ing” or other suffix.

## Updates
#### 14 October 2015
Hi guys, sorry about any confusion that may have happened with the 5 people, but Professor Smith was pretty awesome and is letting us work in a team of 5. She had also already let us pursue this project despite being an observational study. Because of this, I really want to make sure that everyone does their best and we do produce a project that is worthy of the work of 5 people.

Since there is a heavy emphasis on coding for the project, it is great that we have 3 people in a CS discipline. This Github page will be where I am keeping the code for the project. It will allow anyone to view/edit the code as they please. I also think that the README file would be a good place to post updates.

Khoa has agreed to reserve a fishbowl in the library from 2-4 every wednesday for us. We can use that as time to work on the project, work on stats homework, or study for midterms. This will start on the 21st. This is not the only time that we can meet, and other times can be arranged if needed, but with 5 people it is difficult to find a time that works for everyone.

I also posted a schedule with a basic outline of tasks we should complete. Hopefuly we can keep to it and be done a week before the final presentation. By next Monday, I think it would be awesome to have our complexity algorithm figured out, so let me know if people have suggestions on what parameters make a word less or more complex. 

It would also be great if people could come up with some ideas for how to get random text from Twitter, Scholarly Journals, Wikipedia, Reddit, and any other sources you can think of (the more the better).

Thanks everyone!<br/>
