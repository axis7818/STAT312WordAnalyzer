# STAT312WordAnalyzer

## Project Description
We want to analyze the complexity of words based on their source, proportion of vowels, \(etc?\). We will use the length of the word as a basic measure of the word’s complexity and this will be our response variable for all questions. 
* What effect does word source have on Complexity? \(Wikipedia, Scholarly Journal, social media \(twitter\), reddit, etc.\)
* What effect does the proportion of vowels in a word have on Complexity?
* More? Words than end in “ing” or other suffix.

[Word Analyzer Files](http://www.mediafire.com/download/zl6f3b9wfp6took/WordAnalyzerDistribution.zip)

Hi guys, I have gotten the software to a point where it can be used to start to collect Data. Download and Extract the files above \(You may also need to download the [.NET framework](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=42643) if you haven't already\). The software only works on Windows. Make sure to provide a date for your source in the software, and uncheck the 'Use Date' box if you cannot find a date. It would be good if everyone could download that and start testing the software. If you have any questions, or find a problem with the software PLEASE LET ME KNOW!

Last Wednesday, we also decided that each of us would gather data from an individual source, and it will be up to you individually to determine how to collect your data, just make sure that you are getting a valid random sample, and document your procedure for collecting data. I think a good target to shoot for would be about 1000 words from your source. 

|Name	|Source to Collect from	|
|-------|-----------------------|
|Cameron|Wikipedia		|
|Khoa	|Scholarly Journals	|
|Matt	|Books/Novels		|
|David	|Reddit			|
|Brad	|Social Media (pick one)|

Khoa has set up a meeting with Professor Smith on Friday 6 Nov 2015 from 1:30-2:30 in her office to talk about Covariates and Regression. If you can make it to that, please do! I will also be meeting with her to talk about some details on collecting data. Once that is done, we can start the first data collection for the pilot study.

Thanks everyone!<br/>

Hi guys, sorry about any confusion that may have happened with the 5 people, but Professor Smith was pretty awesome and is letting us work in a team of 5. She had also already let us pursue this project despite being an observational study. Because of this, I really want to make sure that everyone does their best and we do produce a project that is worth of the work of 5 people.

Since there is a heavy emphasis on coding for the project, it is great that we have 3 people in a CS discipline. This Github page will be where I am keeping the code for the project. It will allow anyone to view/edit the code as they please. I also think that the README file would be a good place to post larger updates (like this one).

Khoa has agreed to reserve a fishbowl in the library from 2-4 every wednesday for us. We can use that as time to work on the project, work on stats homework, or study for midterms. This will start on the 21st. This is not the only time that we can meet, and other times can be arranged if needed, but with 5 people it is difficult to find a time that works for everyone.

I also posted a schedule with a basic outline of tasks we should complete. Hopefuly we can keep to it and be done a week before the final presentation. By next Monday, I think it would be awesome to have our complexity algorithm figured out, so let me know if people have suggestions on what parameters make a word less or more complex. 

It would also be great if people could come up with some ideas for how to get random text from Twitter, Scholarly Journals, Wikipedia, Reddit, and any other sources you can think of (the more the better). The links at the bottom of this post have our current ideas.

Some other links:
* [Word Complexity Algorithm](https://github.com/axis7818/STAT312WordAnalyzer/blob/master/WordComplexity.md)
* [Word Sources](https://github.com/axis7818/STAT312WordAnalyzer/blob/master/DataRetrieval.md)
* [RexEgg](http://www.rexegg.com/) Regular Expressions are something that will be of great use in this project. I suggest that Khoa and Brad have a look here to get a basic understanding of what they are. \(I think they are awesome...\)


Thanks everyone!<br/>
